        "Today, about 80% of the data organizations generate is \"unstructured\"; data that either does not have a well-defined schema or cannot be restructured into a familiar columnar format. Typical examples of unstructured data include free-form text, images, videos, and sound clips. Moreover, this data imbalance towards unstructured data is expected to grow in the coming decades.\n",
        "\n",
        "Unstructured data is high-dimensional and noisy,    making it more challenging to analyze and interpret using traditional methods. But it is also packed with information and meaning.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Traditionally, unstructured data is processed to extract specific features, effectively turning it into structured data. Once in the realm of structured data, we can search the data with SQL queries (if stored in a relational database) or with a text search engine. \n",
        "The approach of transforming unstructured data into structured data has a few issues; first, engineering features out of structured data can be computationally expensive and error-prone, significantly delaying when we can effectively use the data. And secondly, we are likely losing fidelity and information since when unstructured data is converted to structured data, some unique or 'latent' features might be lost or overlooked because they can't be easily categorized or quantified."

By \"vectorizing,\" we mean to somehow convert something like a text passage, an image, a video, or a song into a flat sequence of numbers representing a particular piece of data. These \"vectors\" are representations of the data in N-dimensional space. By vectorizing, we gain the ability to use linear algebra techniques to compare, group, and operate on our data. This is the foundation of a Vector Database, the ability to store and operate on vectors.\n",

For categorical data, one-hot Encoding is a commonly used approach. And Hashing and Feature Extraction techniques, such as edge detection, texture analysis, or color histograms, have been employed for high-dimensionality data like images.\n",

Consider, for example, how a text passage could be restructured—through sentence rearrangement, synonym usage, or alterations in narrative style. Such Simple modifications could effectively sidestep techniques like Bag-of-Words, preventing systems using the generated encodings from identifying texts with similar meanings.\n",

It even has  a handle in the bottom of the saddle so you can easily help your child during training!  The Jigger is among the most lightweight children\\u2019s bikes on the planet. It is designed so that 2-3 year-olds fit comfortably in a molded ride position that allows for efficient riding, balanced handling and agility. The Jigger\\u2019s frame design and gears work together so your buddingbiker can stand up out of the seat, stop rapidly, rip over trails and pump tracks. The Jigger\\u2019s is amazing on dirt or pavement. Your tike will speed down the bike path in no time. The Jigger will ship with a coaster brake. A freewheel kit is provided at no cost. \"\n",

This is referred to as \"Asymmetric Semantic Search,\" often employed in cases where the search query and the documents being searched are of different nature or structure. Suitable models for asymmetric semantic search include pre-trained MS MARCO Models. MS MARCO models are trained on the Microsoft MAchine Reading COmprehension (MS MARCO) dataset, optimizing them for understanding real-world queries and retrieving relevant responses. They are widely used in search engines, chatbots, and other AI applications. At the time of this writing, the highest performing MS MARCO model tuned for cosine-similarity from SentenceTranformers is `msmarco-distilbert-base-v4`. \n",

Fat Kenda Booster tires give you grip in corners and on wet trails. The Shimano Tourney drivetrain offered enough gears for finding a comfortable pace to ride uphill, and the Tektro hydraulic disc brakes break smoothly. Whether you want an affordable bike that you can take to work, but also take trail riding on the weekends or you\\u2019re just after a stable, comfortable ride for the bike path, the Summit gives a good value for money.\",\n",
